Comment: The file 'LuaPLC_Introduction.pdf' was filtered out as there is
 no source available we could rebuild that file.
 The Javascript file html/jquery.js can be reused from the a packaged version.
 The folder 'pdu-dotnet-api/src/bin' did include some prebuild files usable
 on the Windows OS systems only and by this are unneeded. Potential prebuild
 *.jar files get excluded as well.
